# TarkovRandomizer
This is a personal project of mine for a friend.

This program will create a randomized loadout of all available pieces of gear found in the game: Escape From Tarkov*

To run the program, follow these steps **WINDOWS ONLY**:
1. Ensure you have Java 8 or newew installed
2. Download TarkovRandomizer.rar
3. Open Extract the folder found within TarkovRandomizer.rar to wherever you would like.
4. Run TarkyRanomizer.exe

*Attachments are no included in the randomization. This is where trader level comes in. You can only buy attachments from that trader level or lower.
*You will need a large amount of roubles to be able to sustainably use these randomized loadouts.
